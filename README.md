# Volume-of-Tooth-RCT

This project estimates the volume change in tooth cavity before and after RCT procedure. Estimation is done using morphological computer vision methods on Microcomputed Tomography dataset.

Launch the project by adjusting the arguments in bash file: RCT_ANALYSIS.sh and running it in the command terminal. Make sure to correct the dataset values and directory paths in the arguments carefully!

Please look into ipynb files for snaps of demo. If dataset is needed, let me know!
